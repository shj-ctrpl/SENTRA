# SENTRA-CTRPL

SENTRA (Small Experimental Neutron Transport and Reactor Analysis) code is a Monte Carlo neutron transport code developed by CT&RPL in Hanyang University.

It is based on MCNP and OpenMC, while mostly developed by undergraduate students. Thus, this code only presents very little features compared to other MC transport codes.

This code is for educational purpose, and we welcome any corrections & supports.
